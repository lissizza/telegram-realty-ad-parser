These rules are mandatory for all Codex-assisted changes in this repository.

1. Never commit directly to `main`.

3. Open a Pull Request from the feature branch into `main`.
4. Merge only through the Pull Request flow.

## Required Flow

1. `git checkout -b feature/<short-description>`
2. Implement and commit changes in that branch
3. `git push origin feature/<short-description>`
4. Create PR to `main`
5. Merge PR
